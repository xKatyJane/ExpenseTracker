# Expense Tracker

A simple expense tracking application built in Python with a graphical user interface using Tkinter and CustomTkinter.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Tkinter and CustomTkinter (for the user interface)
- SQLite (for local database storage)

## Description
This application allows users to track their expenses through an intuitive and easy-to-use interface created with CustomTkinter. The expenses data is stored locally in an SQLite database, which is initialized with a setup script included in the project.

## Features
- **Add Expenses:** Enter expense details such as date, description, category, and amount.
- **Input Validation:** User input is validated to ensure correct data format and prevent errors.
- **Delete Expenses:** Remove selected expense records from the database.

- **Monthly overview:** Monthly expenses overview, with a pie chart and a summary with the expense categories and total spending.
